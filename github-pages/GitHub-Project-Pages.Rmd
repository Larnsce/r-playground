with CLI still to be figured out properly:

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-using-the-command-line/

1. Clone repository
2. cd to repository
3. creat gh-pages branch with `git checkout --orphan master`
4. remove all files (not sure why!)
5. add content and `git push origin gh-pages`

This file explores the World Bank Projects dataset downloaded from https://datahub.io/dataset/world-bank-project-database. The dataset comes as a json file, which is the first time I experience working with such a file. Therefore I am using the opportunity to explore working with json files on this data set.

# Install packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("rjson")

library(rjson) 

json_data <- fromJSON(file = "http://go.worldbank.org/KTPE1WKU20") ## tried to use the URL but didn't work

data = fromJSON(file = "datapackage.json") ## this worked, while `json_str` didn't work

data

```

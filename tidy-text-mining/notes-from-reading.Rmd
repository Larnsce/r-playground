```{r}

library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)

# this is a character vector

text <- c("Because I could not stop for Death -",
          "He kindly stopped for me -",
          "The Carriage held but just Ourselves -",
          "and Immortality")

# save character vector as dataframe with dplyr package

text_df <- dplyr::data_frame(line = 1:4, text = text)

# make dataset tidy by using unnest_tokens function. "word" is the output variable, text is the input variable

text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

```

The documentation can be found here:

http://walkerke.github.io/2016/12/rmd-dropdowns/

```{r}

library(bsselectR)

quotes <- c("Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.", 
            "A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.", 
            "My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.")

names(quotes) <- c("Einstein", "Shakespeare", "Angelou")

bsselect(quotes, type = "text")

```
